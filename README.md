# Butter Armor

> _I can't belive it's now Armor!_ - Someone, probabbly, I'm sure.

You ever look at an item in a voxel game that sorta looks like an ingot, and go
"I can't belive that's not armor?" Well, I do that too. That's why I've already
made a chocolate armor (which, it turns out, wasn't very original). It's also
why I've made this mod.

Unlike other food-armor mods, my food armor is edible out of the box. To give
credit where it's due, `moarmour` now does support my `ediblestuff_api`.

## Supported food sources

TODO

- The cheese mod
- Farming
- Food basic?
- MCL_morefood?
- x_farming?
- and others, I don't yet have a grasp on what processed dairy mods are availiable.

## Provided items

TODO

- Butter armor set
- Butter armor tools
